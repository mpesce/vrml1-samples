# Example five- using the Transform node, creating the Earth

# Here comes the Sun
# The Separator node groups everything within it together
Separator {

	# The material will effect all subsequent nodes
	# The sun is yellow, isn't it?  Additive color means red + green = yellow
	# We're switching to emissive color because the Sun gives off light.
	Material {
		emissiveColor 1 1 0    	# The Sun emits lots of yellow light
	}

	Sphere {
		radius 10		# Big Sun
	}

	# We place the Earth within it's own Separator
	# To keep everything good and isolated
