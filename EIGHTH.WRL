# Example eight -create a link from the Sun to an HTML document

# Here comes the Sun
# The Separator node groups everything within it together
Separator {

	# The material will effect all subsequent nodes
	# The sun is yellow, isn't it?  Additive color means red + green = yellow
	# We're switching to emissive color because the Sun gives off light.
	Material {
		emissiveColor 1 1 0    	# The Sun emits lots of yellow light
	}

	# The WWWAnchor node is a group node
	# This means that all objects within it are linked with the anchor's URL
	# We want to link the Sun, so the Sun's Sphere node goes inside of it.
	WWWAnchor {
		name "http://www.w3.org/" # The root URL of the World Wide Web

		# Inside the anchor, because WWWAnchor is a group node
		Sphere {
			radius 10		# Big Sun
		}
	}

	# We place the Earth within it's own Separator
	# To keep everything good and isolated
	Separator {

		# Let's move things out of the way here
		Transform {
			translation 0 20 20
		}

		# Color the Earth blue, and make it absorb light
		# But also make it a reflective, like water
		Material {
			diffuseColor 0 0 1 # Big blue marble
			shininess 0.9 # Water is rather shiny
		}

		# Finally, create the earth
		Sphere {
			radius 2	# Little Earth
		}

		# The Moon gets its own Separator
		# Because we really do keep everything separate
		Separator {

			# The Moon is just outside the Earth
			Transform {
				translation 4 4 0
			}

			# Color the Moon grey, make it absorb light
			# It's a little shiny, but not much
			Material {
				diffuseColor 0.7 0.7 0.7
				shininess 0.3
			}

			# And now, create the Moon
			Sphere {
				radius 1	# Tiny Moon
			}
